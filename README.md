# Deduction of DDoS Attack using Machine Learning model
This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for building and evaluating various machine learning models, focusing on multi-class classification tasks. The models are trained on a structured dataset to classify instances into distinct categories using a variety of algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

# Key Features

Data Preprocessing:

  Efficient handling of both numerical and categorical features.
  Scaling of numerical data for optimal model performance.
  Feature selection by removing highly correlated variables to prevent redundancy.


Machine Learning Models:
  Random Forest Classifier
  Gradient Boosting Classifier
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Logistic Regression


Model Evaluation Metrics:
  Accuracy
  Precision
  Recall
  F1 Score
  ROC-AUC (for evaluating performance in multi-class settings)


Dimensionality Reduction:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dataset's dimensions, allowing easier visualization and understanding of the data.
